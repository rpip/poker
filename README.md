A Poker deck library

```shell
iex> Poker.ranking(~w[2S 3S 4S 5S 6S])
:straight_flush
iex> Poker.rank(black: ~w(3H 3D 3S 9C KD), white: ~w(2C 3H 4S 8C AH))
Black wins - three of a kind
```

## How it works

Watch this video on how to play Poker.

## Ranking algorithms

* straight flush - any five cards in sequence of the same suit. e.g: 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S. TIE: In this case, the player with the highest card wins
* four of a kind - four cards of the same rank, such as four kings. Also called quads
* full house - three cards of one rank plus two cards of another rank. Called Jacks Full of Nines
* flush - five cards of the same suit (but not a straight flush)
* straight - any five numbered cards in sequence, that are not of the same suit.
* three of a kind - 3 cards of the same number, and the other two donâ€™t match each other. Also called trip
* two pairs - Out of five cards, you have two pairs
* pair - out of five cards you have 1 pair
* high card - none of the above

Each algorithm has an associated tie breaker implemented in Elixir for breaking ties.
